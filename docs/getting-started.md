# Getting Started

## Creating an account

To create an account you must have the following:

1. Valid email address that can be accessible.
2. Password that is at least 8 characters long.

## Creating your first project

When creating your first project, there is a few things that should be noted prior to creation

1. Your project's unique name **cannot** be changed.
2. Deleting your project will remove **everything**.

Your project does not need to contain a unique title but must have a unique name that is **all lowercase and contains no special characters** as this will be referenced in everything you do.

NOTE: When creating your project, you will have a specific editor account generated using the same email address and password. Your password can be changed upon your first login in the editor.

# Managing your project

We have created your project, now we have to access it. Pinco CMS is all hosted through the cloud thus not requiring you to create a specific deployment environment for the CMS. You can access the CMS via [https://manage.benecms.com/](https://manage.benecms.com/)

**Remember to login using the same email and password as your main account**

Once you have logged in, then you are good to go!
