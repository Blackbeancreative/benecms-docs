# Documents

## Creating a document

For creating a document, make sure your document is clearly titled. The slug will be pre-generated based off of the title.

You can create your document by accessing the collection that you want your Document to be stored.

**NOTE:** You must have a schema created for your Document.

## Modifying a document

All documents can be modifiable and your content validation will be built in as it is being provided by the Schema

## Drafting

You can set your document into Drafting mode, this will hide the Document from being publicized unless the Developer uses `?preview=true` at the end of the REST API.
