# Tags

## What are tags?

Tags is a way of assigning different documents to different categories beyond their collections. This could be useful as a means of organizing blog posts into sub-categories behind just a "Blogs" or "Posts" collection.

Documents **can be multi-tagged** meaning they can have more than one tag associated to them.

## Creating a tag

For creating a tag, make sure your tagname has no spaces (any spaces will be replaced with "_").

You can create your tag by accessing "Manage Tags" inside of the Tags menu in the side bar.

## Tagging a document

When accessing a Document, on the right hand side you will see a dropdown that allows you the ability to select different tags. When tagging a document, a pill-styled label will appear below the dropdown meaning the Document can be pulled from that tag specifically.
