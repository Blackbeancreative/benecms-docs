# Collections

## What are collections?

Collections is an organization place where your documents will be stored. You can imagine a simple layout being like follows.

For a blogging site, we'd like to have data separated between posts and the pages themselves. If we wanted a Home page, about page and wanted to have separate content for example. However by separating data into Collections (such as Blogs) it allows us to have all blog posts in one area which can be useful if we ever make a "Blogs" page where Developers can easily cycle through that data.

```
Collections
-- Pages
---| Home
---| About
-- Blogs
---| My first blog
---| My second blog
---| My third blog
```

## Creating a collection

For creating a collection, make sure your collection name has no spaces (any spaces will be replaced with "_").

You can create your collection by accessing "Manage Collections" inside of the Collections menu in the side bar.
