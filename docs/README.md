# Bene CMS

Welcome to our official Documentation for Bene CMS, we are a headless data-driven based CMS that allows Developers to have more freedom with what content they want to show and how they show case it.

Editors will be able to learn the basics of how to use the Editor and understand some of the fundamentals of how this CMS works.

Developers will be able to learn how to use the information saved in the CMS and deploy it into their frontend apps that are built with any framework with REST support. This includes React, Next, Gatsby, Eleventy, Angular and so much more.
