# Editors

## Adding an Editor

Creating an editor is a very simple process that only requires knowing the email address of the editor and understanding what role you would like to give your Editor.

On creation of the Editor, they will be sent an email containing a temporary pass that will be mandatory change upon login.

## Assigning Roles

Giving an editor specific roles will help yourself and help the Editor not have more access than they need. A general content editor will likely never have the need to modify Schema or Collection content but allowing them access can create confusion and lead to potential misuses of content managing.

**Content / Documents** will only allow the Editor to modify data inside of a Document.

**Collections and Tags** will allow the Editor to modify Content / Documents and modify Documents that are inside of a collection as well as modify the Collection itself. **As of July 29th, 2021** this role will now allow you to modify and manage Tags.

**Collections, Tags and Schemas** will allow the Editor to modify Content / Documents and modify anything belonging to Collections and Schemas. This role should mainly be assigned to someone who either knows what they are doing or is a **developer**.

**Manager** will give full access to allow modification of any form of data including the addition / deletion of Editors.
